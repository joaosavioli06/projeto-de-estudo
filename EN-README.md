# study-project

In this repository is located my study project to help me progress in programming. I decided to start this project, because after a good amount of time studying, I realized that I should put more focus on my learning and study the right technologies at the right time. Many things can change in this project, but my initial goal is:

Study:
* Git and GitHub (20 hours)
* Python  ||  Ruby  (20 hours)
* Django  ||  Rails (20 hours)
* Object Orientation 

Goals:
* Study 4 technologies
* 20 hours of each subject
* Build a real project

Incentives:
* Measure programming time
* Measuring code creation

As stated in the beginning of the project description, some things may change over time, but I want to do everything I can to study Python or Ruby. My focus is to start my studies on the back-end. I will try to study using free courses and materials, I don't intend to buy courses or anything like that. I am starting this project on 05/17/2023, I hope to have significant results by the end of this year. The goal is to have more knowledge and start studying the right way.
