# Study Project

In this repository is located my study project to help me progress in programming. I decided to start this project, because after a good amount of time studying, I realized that I should put more focus on my learning and study the right technologies at the right time. Many things can change in this project, but my initial goal is:

## Study:
- [x] What's Git and how to use it 
- [x] Learn more about GitHub
<BR>

- [x] Basic Python (Probably won't study anymore) 
- [x] Object Orientation 
* What's a Database? 
     * Learn MYSQL

* JavaScript
<br>

* What are Containers? 

    * Specifically Docker
* What are Programming libraries?
* What's an API?
* What are Frameworks?

<br>

* Continue studying... 


## Goals:
* Study and learn more about programming in general
* Learn JavaScript
* Build a real project and algorithms

## Incentives:
* Measure programming time
* Measuring code creation
