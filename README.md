# Study Project

In this repository is located my study project to help me progress in programming. I decided to start this project, because after a good amount of time studying, I realized that I should put more focus on my learning and study the right technologies at the right time. Many things can change in this project, but my initial goal is:

## Study:
* What's Git and how to use it

* Learn more about GitHub
<BR>

* Python 
* Object Orientation 
* What's a Database? 
     * Learn MYSQL
* Learn how to use Django or Flask 
   
* JavaScript
<br>

* What are Containers? 

    * Specifically Docker
* What are Programming libraries?
* What's an API?
* What are Frameworks?

<br>

* Continue studying... 


## Goals:
* Study and learn more about programming in general
* Start learning Python and JavaScript
* Build a real project and algorithms

## Incentives:
* Measure programming time
* Measuring code creation

## Important!
As stated in the beginning of the project description, some things may change over time, but I want to do everything I can to study Python. My focus is to start my studies on the back-end. I will try to study using free courses and materials, I don't intend to buy so much courses or anything like that. I am starting this project on 05/17/2023, I hope to have significant results by the end of this year. The goal is to have more knowledge and start studying the right way.

##We have an update!
I received some advices about learning JavaScript, this language is getting famous and so much used day by day, it's going to be important learning it. I'm deciding which one I'll focus right now, but I intend to study both as long as I can. Recently, I bought some courses on Udemy, they're gonna help me in my studies. They'll give a better direction to study and don't waste time searching for material, and the better thing, they were cheap :)
