# study-project

In this repository is located my study project to help me progress in programming. I decided to start this project, because after a good amount of time studying, I realized that I should put more focus on my learning and study the right technologies at the right time. Many things can change in this project, but my initial goal is:

Study:
* Git 
* GitHub
* API
* Conteiners
* Frameworks
* Programming libraries 
* Python    
* Database 
* Object Orientation 
* Django  
* Continue studying... 

Goals:
* Study and learn more about programming in general
* Start learing Python 
* Build a real project and algorithms

Incentives:
* Measure programming time
* Measuring code creation

As stated in the beginning of the project description, some things may change over time, but I want to do everything I can to study Python. My focus is to start my studies on the back-end. I will try to study using free courses and materials, I don't intend to buy courses or anything like that. I am starting this project on 05/17/2023, I hope to have significant results by the end of this year. The goal is to have more knowledge and start studying the right way.
